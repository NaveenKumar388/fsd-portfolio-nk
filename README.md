My Full Stack Dev journey - zero to hero

# 🏗️ Fullstack Development Portfolio – NaveenKumar

This repository documents my journey from **0 → 99% Fullstack Developer**.  
I’m starting from **pure HTML/CSS/JS basics** and will gradually move toward  
modern frontend, backend, fullstack integration, and deployment.

## 📌 Learning States  

I’ve divided my journey into **5 states** for better clarity:  

| State | Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **0%** | Foundation | HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics |
| **30%** | Frontend Core | React, Next.js, UI frameworks |
| **50%** | Backend Core | Node.js, Django, APIs & DB |
| **75%** | Advanced Fullstack | MERN, Realtime apps, Auth, Payments |
| **99%** | Deployment & DevOps | Docker, AWS, CI/CD |
